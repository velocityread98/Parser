We will take\nNatural Language Processing—or NLP for short—in a wide sense to cover any kind of\ncomputer manipulation of natural language. At one extreme, it could be as simple as\ncounting word frequencies to compare different writing styles. At the other extreme,\nNLP involves “understanding” complete human utterances, at least to the extent of\nbeing able to give useful responses to them.",

Does the\ntext provide enough evidence for you to accept the hypothesis? In this particular case,\nthe answer will be “No.” You can draw this conclusion easily, but it is very hard to\ncome up with automated methods for making the right decision. The RTE Challenges\nprovide data that allow competitors to develop their systems, but not enough data for\n“brute force” machine learning techniques (a topic we will cover in Chapter 6 ). Con-\nsequently, some linguistic analysis is crucial. In the previous example, it is important\nfor the system to note that Sandra Goudie names the person being defeated in the\nhypothesis, not the person doing the defeating in the text. As another illustration of\nthe difficulty of the task, consider the following text-hypothesis pair:",

We do this by prefixing the string with the letter r , to indicate that it is a raw\nstring . For example, the raw string r'\\band\\b' contains two \\b symbols that are\ninterpreted by the re library as matching word boundaries instead of backspace char-\nacters.

A much better alternative is to store the value of $V_2$ in a table and\nlook it up whenever we need it. The same goes for other values, such as $V_3$ and so on.\nFunction virahanka2() implements a dynamic programming approach to the problem.\nIt works by filling up a table (called lookup ) with solutions to all smaller instances of\nthe problem, stopping as soon as we reach the value we're interested in. At this point\nwe read off the value and return it. Crucially, each subproblem is only ever solved once.",

Accordingly, this is known as the bottom-up approach to\ndynamic programming. Unfortunately it turns out to be quite wasteful for some ap-\nplications, since it may compute solutions to sub-problems that are never required for\nsolving the main problem. This wasted computation can be avoided using the top-\ndown approach to dynamic programming, which is illustrated in the function vira\nhanka3() in Example 4-9. Unlike the bottom-up approach, this approach is recursive.\nIt avoids the huge wastage of virahanka1() by checking whether it has previously stored\nthe result. If not, it computes the result recursively and stores it in the table. The last\nstep is to return the stored result. The final method, in virahanka4(), is to use a Python\n“decorator” called memoize, which takes care of the housekeeping work done by\nvirahanka3() without cluttering up the program. This “memoization” process stores\nthe result of each previous call to the function along with the parameters that were\nused. If the function is subsequently called with the same parameters, it returns the\nstored result instead of recalculating it. (This aspect of Python syntax is beyond the\nscope of this book.)",

This is the approach\ntaken by Hidden Markov Models . Hidden Markov Models are similar to consecutive\nclassifiers in that they look at both the inputs and the history of predicted tags. How-\never, rather than simply finding the single best tag for a given word, they generate a\nprobability distribution over tags. These probabilities are then combined to calculate\nprobability scores for tag sequences, and the tag sequence with the highest probability\nis chosen. Unfortunately, the number of possible tag sequences is quite large. Given a\ntag set with 30 tags, there are about 600 trillion (30 $^{10}$ ) ways to label a 10-word sentence.\nIn order to avoid considering all these possible sequences separately, Hidden Markov\nModels require that the feature extractor only look at the most recent tag (or the most\nrecent n tags, where n is fairly small). Given that restriction, it is possible to use dynamic\nprogramming ( Section 4.7 ) to efficiently find the most likely tag sequence. In particular,\nfor each consecutive word index i , a score is computed for each possible current and\nprevious tag. This same basic approach is taken by two more advanced models, called\nMaximum Entropy Markov Models and Linear-Chain Conditional Random\nField Models ; but different algorithms are used to find scores for tag sequences.",

This\napproach to parsing is known as chart parsing . We introduce the main idea in this\nsection; see the online materials available for this chapter for more implementation\ndetails.",

Can a computer understand\nthe meaning of a sentence? And how could we tell if it did? This is similar to asking\n“ Can a computer think? ” Alan Turing famously proposed to answer this by examining\nthe ability of a computer to hold sensible conversations with a human (Turing, 1950).\nSuppose you are having a chat session with a person and a computer, but you are not\ntold at the outset which is which. If you cannot identify which of your partners is the\ncomputer after chatting with each of them, then the computer has successfully imitated\na human. If a computer succeeds in passing itself off as human in this “ imitation game ”\n(or “ Turing Test ” as it is popularly known), then according to Turing, we should be\nprepared to say that the computer can think and can be said to be intelligent. So Turing\nside-stepped the question of somehow examining the internal states of a computer by\ninstead using its behavior as evidence of intelligence. By the same reasoning, we have\nassumed that in order to say that a computer understands English, it just needs to",

Moreover, even at a given level there may be different\nlabeling schemes or even disagreement among annotators, such that we want to rep-\nresent multiple versions. A second property of TIMIT is its balance across multiple\ndimensions of variation, for coverage of dialect regions and diphones. The inclusion of\nspeaker demographics brings in many more independent variables that may help to\naccount for variation in the data, and which facilitate later uses of the corpus for pur-\nposes that were not envisaged when the corpus was created, such as sociolinguistics.\nA third property is that there is a sharp division between the original linguistic event\ncaptured as an audio recording and the annotations of that event. The same holds true\nof text corpora, in the sense that the original text usually has an external source, and\nis considered to be an immutable artifact. Any transformations of that artifact which\ninvolve human judgment—even something as simple as tokenization—are subject to\nlater revision; thus it is important to retain the source material in a form that is as close\nto the original as possible.",

Although grammar-based NLP is still a significant area of research, it has become\nsomewhat eclipsed in the last 15 – 20 years due to a variety of factors. One significant\ninfluence came from automatic speech recognition. Although early work in speech\nprocessing adopted a model that emulated the kind of rule-based phonological pho-\nnology processing typified by the Sound Pattern of English (Chomsky & Halle, 1968) ,\nthis turned out to be hopelessly inadequate in dealing with the hard problem of rec-\nognizing actual speech in anything like real time. By contrast, systems which involved\nlearning patterns from large bodies of speech data were significantly more accurate,\nefficient, and robust. In addition, the speech community found that progress in building\nbetter systems was hugely assisted by the construction of shared resources for quanti-\ntatively measuring performance against common test data. Eventually, much of the\nNLP community embraced a data-intensive orientation to language processing, cou-\npled with a growing use of machine-learning techniques and evaluation-led\nmethodology.",

During this period of the 17th and 18th\ncenturies, philosophers argued that human reason or sensory experience has priority\nover revelation.

For example, they argued that the principles\nof Euclidean geometry were developed using human reason, and were not the result of\nsupernatural revelation or sensory experience. In contrast, Locke and others took the\nempiricist view, that our primary source of knowledge is the experience of our faculties,\nand that human reason plays a secondary role in reflecting on that experience. Often-\ncited evidence for this position was Galileo's discovery—based on careful observation\nof the motion of the planets—that the solar system is heliocentric and not geocentric.\nIn the context of linguistics, this debate leads to the following question: to what extent\ndoes human linguistic experience, versus our innate “ language faculty, ” provide the",

A right whale is com-\nmonly found alone or in small groups of 1 to 3, but when courting, they may form\ngroups of up to 30. Like most baleen whales, they are seasonally migratory. They inhabit\ncolder waters for feeding and then migrate to warmer waters for breeding and calving.\nAlthough they may move far out to sea during feeding seasons, right whales give birth\nin coastal areas. Interestingly, many of the females do not return to these coastal breed-\ning areas every year, but visit the area only in calving years. Where they go in other\nyears remains a mystery.",

          "text": "Right whales are among the slowest swimming whales, although they may reach speeds\nup to 10 mph in short spurts. They can dive to at least 1,000 feet and can stay submerged\nfor up to 40 minutes. The right whale is extremely endangered, even after years of\nprotected status. Only in the past 15 years is there evidence of a population recovery\nin the Southern Hemisphere, and it is still not known if the right whale will survive at\nall in the Northern Hemisphere. Although not presently hunted, current conservation\nproblems include collisions with ships, conflicts with fishing activities, habitat de-\nstruction, oil drilling, and possible competition from other whale species. Right whales\nhave no teeth, so ear bones and, in some cases, eye lenses can be used to estimate the\nage of a right whale at death. It is believed that right whales live at least 50 years, but\nthere is little data on their longevity.",
